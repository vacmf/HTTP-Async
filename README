HTTP::Async

This module lets you process several HTTP connections at once, in parallel and
without blocking.

This module is a fork of HTTP-Async 0.09 by Edmund von der Burg. The main
reason of this work is to change the client timeout behavior..

The original module is available from CPAN:
http://search.cpan.org/~evdb/HTTP-Async-0.09
